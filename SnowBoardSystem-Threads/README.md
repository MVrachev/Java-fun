*Snow Board reservation system *

This is my first multithreading application.

In this project there is one Cash Desk in which many snowboarders  try to buy a card.
They race trought the tracks and after that they return the card.

The snowboarders are threads and their racing trought the tracks is done with Thread.sleep().

The tracks are limited with a certain number of snowborders and if a new snowboarder came  if they are full then the new snowborder will wait until its notified that there is a free place.
